# iris-project-
This repository contains an end-to-end Iris species classification project. Using Fisher's classic 1936 dataset (150 samples of setosa, versicolor, virginica), we implement ML models with Streamlit UI. Features include Firestore data integration, sklearn's Decision Tree classifier, and performance metrics.
